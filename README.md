## How to Use This Project

1. **Download the Files**: Click the green "Code" button above and choose "Download ZIP" to get all the files.
2. **Unzip the Files**: Open the ZIP file on your computer to see the project files.
3. **Find Someone to Run It**: Since this project uses Python (a programming language), you’ll need to ask a friend who knows Python to run the `track_prices.py` file for you. They’ll need to:
   - Have Python installed on their computer.
   - Install some tools (listed in `requirements.txt`).
   - Run the script to see the charts.
4. **Look at the Charts**: The script will create pictures (charts) showing real estate price trends in Taiwan.

## What’s in This Project
